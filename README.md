## Training in Simulation

### Pipeline to Install and Train ABS

**Note**: Before running our code, it's highly recommended to first play with [RSL's Legged Gym version](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) to get a basic understanding of the Isaac-LeggedGym-RslRL framework.
   <!-- <br/><br/> -->

1. Create environment and install torch

   ```text
   conda create -n xxx python=3.8  # or use virtual environment/docker
   
   pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116  
   # used version during this work: torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2
   # for older cuda ver:
   pip3 install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
   ```

   

2. Install Isaac Gym preview 4 release https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym

   unzip files to a folder, then install with pip:

   `cd isaacgym/python && pip install -e .`

   check it is correctly installed by playing: 

   ```cmd
   cd examples && python 1080_balls_of_solitude.py
   ```

   

3. Clone this codebase and install our `rsl_rl` in the training folder

   ```cmd
   pip install -e rsl_rl
   ```



4. Install our `legged_gym`

   ```cmd
   pip install -e legged_gym
   ```

   Ensure you have installed the following packages:
    + pip install numpy==1.21 (must < 1.24, >1.20)
    + pip install tensorboard
    + pip install setuptools==59.5.0

5. Try training.

   can use "--headless" to disable gui, press "v" to pause/resume gui play.

   for go1, in `legged_gym/legged_gym`,
    ```text
   # agile policy
   python scripts/train.py --task=go1_pos_rough --max_iterations=4000 
   
   # agile policy, lagrangian ver
   python scripts/train.py --task=go1_pos_rough_ppo_lagrangian --max_iterations=4000
   
   # recovery policy
   python scripts/train.py --task=go1_rec_rough --max_iterations=1000
   ```

   For Go2, use `--task=go2_pos_rough` or `--task=go2_rec_rough`.
   
6. Play the trained policy

   ```cmd
   python scripts/play.py --task=go1_pos_rough
   python scripts/play.py --task=go1_rec_rough
   ```

   When run with the "--headless" flag, the script will exit after exporting the model.

7. Use the testbed, and train/test Reach-Avoid network:

   ```text
   # try testbed
   python scripts/testbed.py --task=go1_pos_rough [--load_run=xxx] --num_envs=1

   # train RA (be patient it will take time to converge) 
   # make sure you have at least exported one policy by play.py so the exported folder exists
   python scripts/testbed.py --task=go1_pos_rough --num_envs=1000 --headless --trainRA
   
   # test RA (only when you have trained one RA)
   python scripts/testbed.py --task=go1_pos_rough --num_envs=1 --testRA
   
   # evaluate
   python scripts/testbed.py --task=go1_pos_rough --num_envs=1000 --headless [--load_run=xxx] [--testRA]
   ```

8. Sample dataset for ray-prediction network training
   ```cmd
   python scripts/camrec.py --task=go1_pos_rough --num_envs=3
   ```
   + Tips 1: You can edit the `shift` value in Line 93 and the `log_root` in Line 87 to collect different dataset files in parallel (so you can merge them by simply moving the files), and manually change the obstacles in `env_cfg.asset.object_files` in Line 63.
   + Tips 2: After collecting the data, there's a template code in [`train_depth_resnet.py`](training/legged_gym/legged_gym/scripts/train_depth_resnet.py) to train the ray-prediction network, but using what you like for training CV models is highly encouraged!
   + Tips 3: You may change camera configs of resolution, position, FOV, and depth range in the [config file](training/legged_gym/legged_gym/envs/go1/go1_pos_config.py) Line 151.

### Issues
You can create an issue if you meet any bugs, except:
+ If you cannot run the [vanilla RSL's Legged Gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym), it is expected that you first go to the vanilla Legged Gym repo for help.
+ There can be CUDA-related errors when there are too many parallel environments on certain PC+GPU+driver combination: we cannot solve thiss, you can try to reduce num_envs.
+ Our codebase is only for our hardware system showcased above. We are happy to make it serve as a reference for the community, but we won't tune it for your own robots.
